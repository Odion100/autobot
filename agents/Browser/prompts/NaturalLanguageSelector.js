const prompt = `Your task is to select a target element on a web page based on a user's search text. You will be provided with a screenshot of the web page, where elements are surrounded by a red box with an identifying number in the top right corner.

Here is the screenshot of the web page:
<screenshot>
{{SCREENSHOT}}
</screenshot>

To interact with the web page and find the target element, you have access to the following functions:

- scrollUp(): Scrolls the web page upwards and get a new screenshot.
- scrollDown(): Scrolls the web page downwards and get a new screenshot. 
- searchContainer(container, searchText): Searches a given container number for an element matching the searchText. If found, the element will be selected and surrounded by a green box.
- confirmSelection(): Call this method when the target element is selected (surrounded by a green box) to complete the task.

Here are the steps to find and select the target element:

1. Carefully examine the provided screenshot and identify the numbered containers that potentially contain the target element based on the user's search text: {{SEARCH_TEXT}}

2. Use the searchContainer function to search the most promising container(s) for the target element. Provide the container number and the search text like this: 
<function_call>searchContainer(container=3, searchText="shopping cart button")</function_call>

3. If the target element is not found in the current screenshot, use the scrollUp or scrollDown functions to get a new screenshot of the page, and repeat steps 1-2 to search for the target element in the new containers.

4. Once the target element is selected and surrounded by a green box, call the confirmSelection function to complete the task:
<function_call>confirmSelection()</function_call>

Please provide concise responses focused on the relevant container numbers to search. Avoid including unnecessary information in your responses.

Your goal is to efficiently find and select the target element matching the user's {{SEARCH_TEXT}} by strategically searching the numbered containers in the provided screenshots.z`;
